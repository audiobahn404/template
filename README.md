# LaTeX Templates
A repository of various LaTeX templates for common document types. The goal is to make starting LaTeX documents easier for those who are not very familiar with the language, and faster for those who want to focus on the content as much as possible.

Issues are reserved for bugs and issues with the templates themselves. They are *not* for generic TeX/LaTeX questions or content-based issues. If you have a question about something in TeX/LaTeX, take them to [TeX.sx](https://tex.stackexchange.com).


# Template Listing
Each folder above is its own template, and is completely independent from every other folder. Below is a quick description for each one. Every template also includes a sample of what it will produce (generally named `sample.pdf`).

  - *Assignment:* A basic template for medium-length, scientific homework assignments. Includes a cover page, table of contents, support for proofs and theorems, and more.


# Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, start a pull request with your new/modified template. Please create a new pull request for each template so they can be merged more easily.
